%p The Teambox API will allow you to connect your applications to Teambox.
%p Some possibilities of what you will be able to do are:

.together
  %img{ :src => "/images/api.png", :style => 'float: left; padding-top: 40px' }
  %ul{ :style => 'float: left' }
    %li Create desktop and mobile clients to access Teambox.
    %li Link your own GTD application with Teambox tasks.
    %li Post messages from other applications, like your own CRM.
    %li Program custom behaviours on Teambox.
    %li Develop browser extensions.
  .clear

%p
  We're here to help you understand how the Teambox API is
  structured and how you can consume it.
%p
  First, you'll need to understand some basic concepts.
  After, we'll run some basic examples and learn how to handle authorization.
  Lastly, we'll jump to the documentation for models: Projects, users, tasks, etc.

%h2 What you should know already

%p
  This documentation assumes you are familiar with HTTP and its usual verbs:
  GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
%p
  Teambox uses a RESTful JSON API. Routes will be specified in this document,
  and the API will return the standard HTTP status codes.

%p
  For <a href="/api/auth">authentication</a>, we support OAuth2 and HTTP Basic Authentication. We recommend you use OAuth2 if you are integrating Teambox with third party services or clients. All Teambox traffic uses HTTPS.

%h2 Your first request
%p
  Try this simple request from your command line to see how the API works:
%pre
  %code
    == curl #{api_v1_projects_url} -u username:password
%p It should return something like this:
%pre
  %code
    = JSON.pretty_generate(example_api_wrap(@project, :references => [:organization, :user]))
%p This is the way we will be handling API requests and data exchange with Teambox.
%p With this simple command, you can get recent activities from Teambox:

%pre
  %code
    == curl #{api_v1_activities_url} -u username:password

%p Try this code snippet from your terminal to post a comment to your projects:

%pre
  %code
    = %(curl -X POST -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u username:password -d '{body: \"Posting using the API!\"}' #{api_v1_project_comments_url('your_project')})

%h2 Useful tools

%p There is a rather nice gem for ruby developers, <a href="https://github.com/teambox/teambox-ruby-client">teambox-client</a>.

%p If you have written a client for your favourite programming language, <a href="http://teambox.com/projects/teambox">please let us know</a>!
