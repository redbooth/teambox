%h2 API structure

%p
  Every part of Teambox can be accessed by the API with simple requests.
  Usual actions include listing objects, adding a new one, editing,
  showing one and destroying a record (index, new, edit, show, delete).

%h2 Understanding Teambox models

%p In Teambox, your account is a User model. A User can belong to many Projects.
%p
  The membership of a User in a Project is represented by a Person model.
  Person stores information like the role and the date when User joined the Project.
%p
  Projects are owned by one User, and have many other Users in it. Projects
  contain Comments, Conversations, Task Lists, Tasks, Pages and Files.
%p
  Comments are the most important concept in Teambox.
  A Comment belongs to a Conversation or a Task, allowing them to be threaded.
  Comments store important information, like the number of hours you spent on
  a Task or status changes for it.
%p Similarly, Task Lists have Tasks. Task Lists provide information like start and end dates.
%p Pages contain different elements: Notes (text with a title), Dividers and Files.
%p Files can belong to a project independently, or they can be attached to a Comment or Page.
%p Invitations are sent before you join a project, to request you to join it.

%h2 HTTP Status Codes

%p
  For each request you make to the Teambox API, we will return an <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">HTTP status code</a>.
  Following convention, the following status codes will be returned for each request:

%ul
  %li 200: Success. The object was found, created, updated or deleted successfully
  %li 404: The object you're looking for doesn't exist.
  %li 406: Not Acceptable (invalid format). You're probably sending wrong JSON or you need to specify the HTTP headers.
  %li 409: Conflict (item already exists).
  %li 422: Unprocessable Entry.
  %li 500: Server Error (hopefully not!). This means our server has some sort of problem.

%h2 Request headers

%p For each request, please specify the following headers:

%pre= "Accept: application/json"

%p You can also use XML and YAML, but they're not officially supported.

%h2 Authentication

%p Teambox currently uses HTTP basic authentication to authenticate requests.
%p Soon we will offer OAuth 2 authentication support, which is more secure and reliable. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mbleigh/the-present-future-of-oauth">Learn more about it here</a>.
  

%h2 General usage 

%p
  The following project objects have APIs: Projects, Activities, Users, Comments,
  Conversations, Task Lists, Tasks, Pages, Invitations and Files. You can access them
  through RESTful interfaces, described below.

%p
  You can also access certain project objects outside projects.
  In this case a list will be returned of objects from all of your projects:

%ul
  %li Task lists <code>/task_lists</code>
  %li Activities <code>/activities</code>

%p You can also access user data shared amongst projects, such as:

%ul
  %li Users <code>/users</code>

%h2 A note about RESTful routes

%p Unless otherwise stated, most objects on the API conform to the following routes:

%ul
  %li GET <code>/collection</code> to list objects
  %li GET <code>/collection/id</code> to show an object
  %li POST <code>/collection</code> to create objects
  %li PUT <code>/collection/id</code> to update an object
  %li DELETE <code>/collection/id</code> to delete an object

%p All API methods accept JSON as input, and will return JSON.
%p XML and YAML might be present on some parts, but are not officially supported.
