  # OAuth single-click login. You can configure Teambox to log in with Github, Facebook and others.
  #
  # To enable this, you'll need to create developer accounts for each provider.
  # The return URL you should use is http://your-domain.com/oauth/:provider/callback
  #
  # We are providing defaults that work for http://localhost:3000, for testing purposes.
  #
  # If signups are enabled, this will allow users to create an account at Teambox.
  # If not, it will still allow them to link their services to existing Teambox accounts.
