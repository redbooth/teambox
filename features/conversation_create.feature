Feature: Creating a conversation

  Background: 
    Given I am logged in as mislav
    And I am currently in the project ruby_rockstars

  Scenario: Mislav sees there are no conversations yet
    When I go to the conversations page
    Then I should see "This project doesn't have any conversations yet"

  Scenario: Mislav creates a valid conversation on his project
    When I go to the conversations page
    And I follow "Create the first conversation in this project"
    Then I should see "New Conversation"
    When I fill in the following:
      | conversation_name | Lets code the next big thing                                            |
      | conversation_body | Im having some ideas for an upcoming project: *Getting Laid*, the book. |
    And I press "Create"
    Then I should see "Lets code the next big thing"
    And I should see "Im having some ideas for an upcoming project: Getting Laid, the book."
    And I should see "People watching:"
    And I should see "Mislav MarohniÄ‡"
    And I should see "Unwatch"
    When I fill in "comment_body" with "Rockets!"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see "Im having some ideas for an upcoming project: Getting Laid, the book."
    And I should see "Rockets!"

      | conversation_name | Lets code the next big thing |
