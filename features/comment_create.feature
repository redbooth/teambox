Feature: Posting a comment on a project wall

  Background: 
    Given a project exists with name: "Ruby Rockstars"
    And I am logged in as mislav
    And I am in the project called "Ruby Rockstars"

  Scenario Outline: I post a comment to the project wall
    When I go to the page of the "Ruby Rockstars" project
    And I fill in "comment_body" with "<body>"
    And I press "Save"
    And I wait for 1 second
    Then I should see "<formatted_body>"

    Examples: 
      | body                                | formatted_body                  |
      | She *used* to _mean_ so much to ME! | She used to mean so much to ME! |
      | Hey, @geoffrey!                     | Hey, @geoffrey!                 |

  Scenario: I post an empty comment to the projects wall
    When I go to the page of the "Ruby Rockstars" project
    And I fill in "comment_body" with ""
    And I press "Save"
    And I wait for 1 second
    Then I should see "Please write about what you have done in the box above."
