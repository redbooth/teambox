Feature: Notifications of comment mentions
  In order to not miss any of the discussions important to me
  As a Teambox user
  I want to be notified when I'm mentioned

  Background: 
    Given a project with users @balint, @pablo, @mislav and @james
    And @balint has his locale set to Italian
    And @pablo has his locale set to Spanish

  Scenario: Mention several users
    Given I am logged in as @balint
    When I go to the project page
    And I fill in the comment box with "Hey, check this out @pablo and @james!"
    And I press "Pubblica"
    Then @pablo and @james should receive an email
    And @balint and @mislav should receive no emails
    When @pablo opens the email
    Then he should see "Conversaci√≥n:" in the email body
    When @james opens the email
    Then he should see "Conversation:" in the email body

  Scenario: Mention all users by using @all in conversation
