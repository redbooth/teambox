Feature: Creating a project

  Background: 
    Given I am logged in as mislav
    And I go to the new project page

  Scenario Outline: Mislav creates two valid projects and fails to create an invalid project
    When I fill in the following:
      | Name      | <name> |
    And I press "Create project and start collaborating"
    Then I should see "<response>"
    And I should see "<flash>"

    Examples: 
      | name                  | response          | flash                          |
      | Title with ()_+&-     | Title with ()_+&- | Your project has been created! |
      | Ruby Rockstars        | Ruby Rockstars    | Your project has been created! |
      | Fucking awesome group | Invalid project   | Invalid project                |
