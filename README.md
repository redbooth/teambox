# Teambox
## Collaboration just got better

[Teambox is project management software](http://teambox.com/) built on Ruby on Rails with a focus on collaboration.

Teambox workflow is project-centered; each project being visible only to people invited to it.
Projects have a status wall, conversations, tasks, shared pages and file uploads. You can even post
to everywhere just using email.

You can [try Teambox online](http://teambox.com/) for free to see how it works. Teambox is open-source software, meaning you
can also download it, change its code and host yourself.
