Things that should be added to seed data:
  - Bio and cards
  - Add dates to some tasks and task lists for Gantt charts and Calendar testing
  - Fix status changes for comments
      Assigning tasks doesn't work status_update(tomas, "message", :status), status_update(tomas, "asdas", users)
      Apparently, the comment is saving but it's not affecting the target.
  - Upload files inside and outside comments
  - Build another project to test overview for all tasks
  - The last comment by Corrina doesn't have a reply field

Living in harmony calls for clearing the physical and subtle bodies of all trauma which cuts off the flow of life force. The True Self emerges as lifelong patterns of fear, pain, and self-limitation dissolve.")

Calming the brain and nervous system directly influences the yogic energy channels, and creates an environment where wellness and wholeness can thrive. Marco’s methods are firmly rooted in both physical and esoteric anatomy. Nationally Certified in bodywork, she trained extensively in structural massage for chronic pain before discovering CranioSacral, SomatoEmotional, and Heart Centered Therapies. Earthworks Yoga’s healing evolution parallels the yogic journey … from the outer body to the inner fibers, cells, and soul. The root causes of suffering reveal themselves through chronic holding patterns in the physical and subtle bodies, and it is on all these levels that Marco works.")
