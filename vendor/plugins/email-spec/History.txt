== 1.0 2010-07-31 Rails 3.0 Release
  This release makes email-spec compatible with Rails 3 and RSpec 2.x.

  IMPORTANT: As of 1.0 email-spec is no longer backwards compatible wit Rails 2.x.  I will be maintaining a 0.6
  branch on github/rubygems for Rails 2 compatibility if anyone wants new features backported.

  This was truly a community effort and I appreciate all of time and effort donated by those involved. Specifically:
    * Maxim Chernyak for the initial conversion work to Rails 3
    * Tim Harper for ironing out various matcher bugs
    * Patrick Muldoon for doing a fantastic job of cleaning up the features and specs.  He also fixed the
      DelayedJob support and worked through all the bundler issues the project was facing.

 === Bugfixes

This release is a general refactoring of the steps and helpers.
The example rails app was also updated to use the lateset rails and webrat.  It also takes advantages
and the newer step definistions including the new third-person forms.

Some of the generated steps are being removed in favor of some of the newer ones.  The older ones
will remain until 0.4.0 but will issue deprecation warnings.

Big shoutout to Kieran Pilkington who did the majority of work for this release.

    With these changes, the following is now possible:

      When they open the email
      Then they should see "Account has been created" in the subject

  * Additional default steps (Balint Erdi)
    * Then /^I should not receive any emails?$/
