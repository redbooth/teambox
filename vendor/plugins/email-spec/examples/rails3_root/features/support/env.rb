# If you set this to true, Rails will rescue all errors and render error

# tagging with @culerity or @javascript will also turn transactions off.
#
# If you set this to false, transactions will be off for all scenarios,
# regardless of whether you use @no-txn or not.
#
# Beware that turning transactions off will leave data in your database 
# after each scenario, which can lead to hard-to-debug failures in
